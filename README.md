# Study of Web Development

Welcome to my repository on the Study of Web Development! ðŸ¥° This repository is part of a comprehensive course I am taking on Udemy, dedicated to diving deep into the world of web development. Throughout this course, I am documenting my journey, challenges, and projects as I progress through the varied landscape of web technologies.

## Languages and Technologies Studied ðŸ«¡

The course covers a broad spectrum of technologies and programming languages essential for modern web development. Here's a list of the key areas I'm exploring:

- **HTML**: The backbone of the web, where it all begins. HTML forms the structure of web pages, providing the skeletal framework upon which we build richer experiences.
- **CSS**: The styling language that brings beauty to the web. Through CSS, I learn how to make websites not just functional but visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: The scripting language that breathes life into web pages. I dive into JavaScript to make websites interactive and dynamic.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime that allows me to run JavaScript on the server. It's a key technology for building scalable network applications.
- **React**: A powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. With React, I'm learning to create fast and reactive web apps.
- **PostgreSQL**: A robust and reliable relational database system. It's where I store and manage the data that powers web applications.
- **Web3 and DApps**: The frontier of web development. Here, I explore how to build decentralized applications (DApps) that run on blockchain technology, introducing me to the exciting world of Web3.

## Objectives ðŸš€

My main objectives in taking this course and working through this repository include:

- Gaining a solid foundation in web development basics through hands-on projects.
- Developing a comprehensive understanding of both client-side and server-side development.
- Exploring the latest in web technology trends, including decentralized applications.
- Building a portfolio of projects that demonstrate my skills and understanding of web development.

## Projects ðŸ’»

This repository contains various projects, exercises, and snippets of code that I've worked on as part of the course. Each project is contained in its own directory, with a specific README.md file that provides more details about the project, including the technologies used, the objectives, and how to run it.

## Learning Journey ðŸ“‘

Join me on this learning journey as I navigate through the complexities and beauty of web development. Through this repository, I aim to share my progress, learnings, and insights with anyone interested in the world of web development, whether you're a fellow student, a curious observer, or a potential collaborator.

Thank you for visiting, and I hope you find something inspiring or useful in my journey into web development!
